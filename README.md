# Promise Example in JavaScript

This project demonstrates how to use **JavaScript Promises** to handle asynchronous operations.

## Features
- Example tasks: 
  - Walk the dog  
  - Clean the kitchen  
  - Take out the trash  
- Each task simulates asynchronous work using `setTimeout`.
- Shows how to use:
  - `resolve` 
  - `reject` 
  - `.then()` chaining
  - `.catch()` error handling

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. Check the console (`F12 → Console`) to see the output of promises.
